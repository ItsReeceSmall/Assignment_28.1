                  <h4>Accessibility</h4>
                  <p>This website incorporates a black, grey and white colour scheme, to allow the reader to view the page easily without issue, it makes the page easier to use. On other web pages, having a set colour scheme with text that is easy to read makes the website more accessible for other people with visibility issues.</p>
                  <h4> Ease of use</h4>
                  <p>Having a website which is easy to use means the user will not leave it due to the difficulty of navigation. In my website, it is very easy to use, it uses hyperlinks to navigate to different pages. The links are clearly labelled for what they navigate to and stand out as a different colour from the background they are on. They would stand out more if they were buttons as they would entice the user to click them.</p>
                  <h4>Functionality</h4>
                  <p>The functionality of a website is key as if there are any broken aspects in the coding of the web pages then the site will not function correctly, so features like JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Ajax and so on need to work in conjunction with the sites elements if the functionality of the site is to be good. On my site the content is all hard coded into the page meaning making changes isn't easy as the individual items have to be changed one by one, what would be more efficient is to use JSON injection to the page so the content is pulled in externally. Overall the functionality of the page works well as the cards of content adjust to screen size.</p>
                  <h4>User Enviornments, Navigation, Links</h4>
                  <p>The hyperlinks are embedded in the navigation bar and the drop down boxes, as well, along with links within the cards to navigate to the corresponding pages.</p>
                  <p>WebsiteMagazine say: 'Effective navigation means simplified navigation. Having a clear and clutter-free navigation is the best thing you can do to make your website friendly for your visitors. Try to limit the number of menu items as far as possible.  Not overcomplicating the things and configuring navigation equally on each page, will greatly facilitate browsing the site'. (WebsiteMagazine, 2016)</p>
                  <h4>Content</h4>
                  <p>My site contains hard coded text content with usage of headers, sub headers and text, pictures are also used in the code to show what is being referred to. It is good to use multiple forms of content to appeal to a wider audience in a website, as then more people find the site interesting to use.</p>
