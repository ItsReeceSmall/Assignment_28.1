                  <h4>Web 2.0</h4>
                  <p>According to Vangie Beal on Webopedia, The definition of Web 2.0 is: 'Web 2.0 is the term given to describe a second generation of the World Wide Web that is focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online. Web 2.0 basically refers to the transition from static HTML Web pages to a more dynamic Web that is more organized and is based on serving Web applications to users.' (Beal, 2015)</p>
                  <p>This aspect of web architecture isn't really physical hardware or an item that needs to be built, it is a list of methods/rules that are compiled which form a website structure, and this can vary from software to hardware. One of the primary features it can provide is social platform integration, for example, embedding on websites, the types of content that can be embedded can include social networks and video sharing site content.</p>
                  <p>With newer features that are beginning to appear within web 2.0 it is now easier to develop websites and pages that are dynamic and always are animated without even having to click or do anything, this is due to the use of scripts and interactive languages which are compatible with the web server that allow websites to become easier to design, make changes to and over all manage. The initial first concept of web 2.0 was to make a wiki, nowadays we have the site Wikipedia which is incredibly big as a website and anyone can add to it, people can provide new information to things online for others to access and view.</p>
                  <h4>Cloud Storage</h4>
                  <p>According to Vangie Beal on Webopedia, The definition of cloud storage is: 'Cloud storage means "the storage of data online in the cloud," wherein a company's data is stored in and accessible from multiple distributed and connected resources that comprise a cloud.' (Beal, 2015)</p>
                  <p>This is a very new, it is similar to the following aspect I am going to identify, that is web storage. Cloud storage is where you store your data online, the only key difference to it from web storage is the data is updated on every device connected to the cloud if it is edited from another device that is connected to the cloud. An example of this in use would be Google Drive, when you make an edit or submit a document to the drive from the client, all devices attached or logged in to that cloud will then download the new or edited data to make all devices connected to the cloud have the same files, the cloud is the master drive as that is what distributes the files out to the devices connected to it. The concept of such technology is so you can access and edit data from anywhere and in a fast way.</p>
                  <h4>Web Storage</h4>
                  <p>This is a new method of storing data; it came to be more known around the same time that Web 2.0 did. In short web storage is a method of storing data on websites through web servers, these web servers can be accessed from a separate device and data from them can be accessed, downloaded and uploaded from another location. An example of web storage would be One Drive, this is a recently reinvented brand from SkyDrive which is free that allows users to store any of their data an access it from their own devices anywhere, providing that they have the correct credentials to access the web storage.</p>
