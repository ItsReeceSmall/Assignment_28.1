                <div class="card-action">
	                <p>There are security risks that come about when maintaining and tracking performance of websites, these risks are high and they are one of the most developing issues of security in technology, this is because of what it runs on, the internet. I will go into detail in the aspect shown below, and how these problems are tackled.</p>
	                <h3>Security Risk</h3>
	                <h4>Spoofing</h4>
	                <p>According to TechTerms.com, Spoofing means; 'The word 'spoof' means to hoax, trick, or deceive.' (TechTerms, 2007)</p>
	                <p>This is where an 'attacker' uses a program or themselves to act/pretend to be an alias that they aren't so that they can gain access to sensitive information such as logins and passwords to networks. This process can be done by providing incorrect or fakes info to someone who has the highest privileges on such network. This is done so they gain trust of that person and they then grant the fake alias access to the network with another members credentials.</p>
	                <h4>Viruses</h4>
	                <p>This is a piece of software which is designed to exploit or attack a network or computer system, these viruses often duplicate themselves and spread to other computers or programs, that is why they were named viruses. They are designed to disrupt the activities of the user of the system or software and take advantage of all the insecure aspects of their system. Viruses can steal information, erase it etc. They exist and are put out for one reason, and that is so the hacker can gain some benefit whether it be through enjoyment or just a past time activity.</p>
	                <h4>Software Exploitation</h4>
	                <p>This is a process where software on a network is attacked and access is given to the attacker purely though a discovered security gap in the software on the network. These attacks can be as simple as the program on the network receiving an unknown command which in turn causes the program to bug out and glitch due to the software not knowing how to handle such command. This then leaves the network on to attackers.</p>
	                <h3>Security Mechanisms</h3>
	                <h4>Firewall</h4>
	                <p>This is a piece of software implemented into a web server to track any incoming or outgoing data on the network, it can restrict ports and viewable websites on the network and prevent unknown and unwanted connections from coming into the network. It analyses not only what comes to and from the internet but also what is going through the LAN (Local area network). Firewall is what packets have to go though to be checked to see if they are allowed on the network. </p>
	                <h4>Common Sense</h4>
	                <p>Despite this may seem obvious, even if you have the tightest and most secure network going, if you accidentally leak your password and username of an account of high permissions then all that security means nothing, ensuring your password is safe and secure is key.</p>
	                <h4>SSL Secure Socket Layer</h4>
	                <p>The term shown above is a piece of software which sits between the webserver and the node that it is attached to, and also the external web. It is used as a secure communication platform over the internet. It does this by encrypting to ensure data cannot be intercepted by others or even used for that matter. This is important as sensitive data shouldn't be able to be acceded on the internet by people it is not supposed to be viewed by.</p>
